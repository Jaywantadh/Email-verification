# Email Verification Software

This project is an Email Verification Software written in Go. It checks if an email address is valid and verifies it by sending a verification email.

## Features

- Validate email format using regular expressions
- Verify the domain of the email address
- Send a verification email with a unique token

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or later
- A valid Gmail account for sending verification emails

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-verification-software.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```sh
cd email-verification-software
```

3. Build the project:

```sh
go build
```

## Usage

1. Run the executable:

```sh
./email-verification-software
```

2. Enter the email address you want to verify when prompted:

```sh
Enter Your Email: example@example.com
```

If the email is valid and the domain is verified, a verification email will be sent to the provided address.

## Configuration

To send verification emails, you need to configure your Gmail account settings:

1. Replace `Your_mail` with your Gmail address in the `sendVerificationEmail` function.
2. Replace `Your_app_password` with your Gmail app password. You can create an app password by following [this guide](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

```go
from := "Your_mail"
password := "Your_app_password"
```

## Code Explanation

- `isValidEmail(email string) bool`: Validates the email format using regular expressions.
- `isDomainValid(email string) bool`: Verifies the domain of the email address using DNS lookup.
- `sendVerificationEmail(email, token string) error`: Sends a verification email to the provided address.
- `main()`: Main function that prompts the user for an email address, validates it, verifies the domain, and sends a verification email if valid.
